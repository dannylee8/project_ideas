* DevTeam - Developer base [mod5 project](https://github.com/dannylee8?tab=repositories&q=m5&type=&language=)

### Needs Planning

** Kids related **

* CSS Art gallery - art sharing, with contests, tips/blogs and prints
* Penpal for kids - build into mobile app for ipad, think about how to verify and safety (private app, invite only)
* Kids art gallery sharing - maybe link this with CSS art tutorials

** Coding tools related **

* JQ tutorial/playground - a site to try out commands and get immediate results
* 3d Mind map of JSON - be able to manipulate nested JSON data using drag and drop functionality to get an export you want.
* CSS Calculator exports bit shapes in CSS format - like a playground to export code.
* Github readme.md to pdf - take a URL of a readme and export a pdf

* virtual business cards - a place to store all your social media business links, easy exchange, social networking and app for connecting
* 60 day workplan lister - include something regarding accountability, daily standups (by video?)

** API related**

* Fetch and serve basic api - a basic API backend setup with authentication for reuse in projects
* Github contributions by users - create a dashboard to see a list of users and their stats 
* Google drive api to see data usage - break down data usage and really see what's taking up space

** job hunt related** 

* website review app - for others to test and critique your site
* Flashcards app for interview - an attractive, easy to learn interface that lets you save flashcards, open to all, no accounts.
* interview question app for answering, editing, scoring - kind of like pramp, but written or video taped and reviewed.  More for cultural interviews and self-practice
* App for identifying skills and what to learn next - a mind map chart to take a full list of skills, highlight in-progress, next and backburner.  Allow bookmarks, sharability.

* Bookmark editor chrome - user can upload a bookmark, user can move folders and bookmarks, user can save/dl file.  Stretch git repo to add version control of edits

### Very Difficult

* Translator software - using IBM watson translation service, provide on the fly translation services of live meetings
* Ruby UML site - a model-relationship drawing tool that takes the rails db.schema and translates it into a diagram for README.md use.

** Video Conferencing related **
* Meeting games - a plugin to add games to meetings like the drawing game from the FDM interview waiting room
* escape room (buttons, switches, etc) 

** Caterint related **

* Catering backend - a backend for cooks (ingredients, amounts, inventory, orderlists) that connects with a front end order system API that allows integration with a front-end framework or shopify style service.
* Lunch and learn - order for others, billing to a single source (variety in billing options to meet business needs), break out delivery addresses (accept spreadsheets)

** Medical related **

* App for neuropsychological testing (using DSM standards), low cost, subscription based for licensed professionals - virual medicine.  Lower the cost of exams and access to resources for those who need testing.
* medical coder software - uninteresting, but an untapped field?
* encrypted mail for medical professionals - bundle with an office management product or as a plugin for a system to conform to HIPAA standards.
